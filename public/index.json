We’re all hoping for new information about the progress against the coronavirus. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these charts is meaningless. In fact, coronavirus case counts are meaningless, unless they are done with very heavy statistical knowledge, and even then they are very messy. Countries have different testing and hospitalization protocols, death certificating standards, and there are less and more trustworthy governments. We do not really know the severity of the local epidemics and the relative success of public health policies.\n\r\r\r Nevertheless, we have some timely information on how people and the economy react to the epidemic, because there are ongoing, frequent, and comparable data sources on various consequences of the epidemic. A particularly interesting big data source is Google’s geolocational reporting on how people’s time spent in homes, workplaces, parks, shopping areas and recreational areas change. Google gets plenty of realtime data from hundreds of millions of people and compares them by days in the week and local time with the ‘baseline’ scenario before the outbreak of the coronavirus.\nBased on the locational data of various smartphones and application data, we know that people spend 10-15% more time at home since January, and 40-50% less in their workplaces. Similar data is available for other locations.\nWhile people are spending less time in the workplace and more at home in every European country, there are significant differences. Countries in the top left corner, most notable Sweden, switched less from workplaces to homes. On the bottom right corner, Spain and Italy, which were most hit by the epidemic, are in the most severe form of lockdown.\nThere are some outliers, like Romania, where people stay a lot more at home, but not so much less in the workplaces – probably they cannot afford to stay clear of the job, but they are reducing other activities. Or, in the case of Germany, people spend a lot more time in parks.\nI grouped the countries according to their dynamics. Looking at Belgium and Luxembourg, we see that they are more locked down than the typical European country, but they are moving up in the first week of April compared to the last week of March. This is very much in line with their improving strain on the health system.\nWhat is worrying is that there appears to be a significant asynchronicity in the Schengen zone, where people and goods should move around freely. The peripheric countries, which are less densely populated, often less integrated into the global transport and travel routes, are getting into the local epidemics later, and are acting later. This is logical from a national point of view, but given that the European economy is very much integrated, it will prolong the pain. The Netherlands, France and Germany need plenty of seasonal agricultural workers from the Southeast, where the lockdown is just getting really strict. While some of their regions see improving national epidemic situations, the easing will increase the intensity of the local epidemic if a large number of workers will arrive from countries that are just going into the epidemic.\nThe efficient solution, as many public health officials keep saying, would be a synchronized effort to contain the virus. The different pace and strictness of social distancing measures will mean that the local epidemics will not be in synchronization, and the countries will re-infect each other, this way prolonging the economic and social cost of this devastating pandemic. While health policy is a national competence in the European Union, in fact, the European economic and social life is so much integrated, not only within the Schengen Zone, but even with future, prospective and candidate members states in the Balkans, that a far more coordinated public health policy would be required.\nUse this in your article?

CEEMID has created thousands of high-value, hard music industry indicators using open data sources, industry data sources, surveys and various APIs to relevant other data sources.\nCEEMID is aiming to transfer thousands of indicators and a verifiable, open-source software that creates them to the European Music Observatory to give Europe-wide access timely, reliable, actionable statistics and indicators for the music industry, policymakers and music professionals. (Read more about our data coverage and our pan-European geographical coverage.)\nWith the help of Consolidated Independent, CEEMID created the Central European Music Industry Report - online, pdf and epub versions 2020, which provides a rich illustration on European cross-country research to provide the music industry businesses and music policymakers with rich data and high-quality indicators for analysis and AI for the innovation pillar of the European Music Observatory by creating input data on the Music Economy of Europe, Music Diversity and Circulation and on Music, Society \u0026amp; Citizenship.\nCEEMID is a private initiative. We developed data products for the needs of the industry: to calculate adequate royalty price (tariff) levels, to calculate adequate compensation for damages, to design better grants, to advocate better CCI policies, to pinpoint discriminative taxation of the industry, to monitor public performance licenses, to calculate the size of the value gap, to train algorithms that find new audience for small nation repertoires abroad, and so on. Because the industry is made of microenterprises all over Europe and the world, and even larger organizations, such as collective management societies are at most SMEs, the industry has very limited market research or research \u0026amp; development capacities. This puts the music industry in a particularly vulnerable position because the biggest distributors of music, such as Alphabet’s Google and YouTube, or Apple’s iTunes and streaming services, or Spotify are data-driven companies that apply AI in all their workflows.\nWhy open data? The music industry cannot get more favourable position in disputes if it is not able to ramp up its data analytics capacities. This is only possible in a collaborative way, because the combined research capacity of the European industry is smaller than its main partner’s capacities individually.\nWe believe that CEEMID could fulfil the functions of the European Music Industry if it would find a sustainable financing that makes access to all our data open. We need to be able to avoid the tragedy of the commons, where only a few industry users contribute to the financing of thousands of indicators that could potentially benefits tens of thousands of stakeholders in the EU.\nWe believe that a very large segment of CEEMID\u0026rsquo;s and the European Music Observatory\u0026rsquo;s data coverage is based on public-interest data that is collected by public authorities. We have also realized that the music industry stakeholders and policymakers, particularly in cultural ministries and similar functions in cities and regions underestimate the availability of open data. The EU open data regime gives access to almost all information stored in government data systems. Because this is in fact re-use of the information, the data for this purpose is usually not documented. While the data is available for free or almost free, only high level of metadata and data processing know-how is required to access it. This know-how is usually missing from cultural policy institutions and music industry bodies.\nTherefore, CEEMID was based on the regulatory framework provided by the Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information provides a common legal framework for a European market for government-held data (public sector information). It a regulatory framework that is built around two key pillars of the internal market: transparency and fair competition. In our view, these principles should apply to European Music Observatory, too.\nIn the EU, open data is governed by the Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information - in short: Open Data Directive (EU) 2019/1024. It entered into force on 16 July 2019. It replaces the Public Sector Information Directive, also known as the ‘PSI Directive’ which dated from 2003 and was subsequently amended in 2013^[@eu_directive_2019_1024; @eu_directive_2013_37; @eu_directive_2003_98]. The founder of CEEMID, Daniel Antal has been involved in Open Data and PSI since 2008.\nWhy open collaboration in data integration? We believe that the European Music Observatory must rely on open-source statistical software written in the R statistical language like CEEMID, and it must be funded on the principle of open collaboration with the industry, public authorities and academia.\nOpen-source software (OSS) is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software is often developed in a collaborative public manner, and which is a prominent example of open collaboration.\nGenerally, the use of open source software, including the open source R language and its software packages or libraries in the national statistical offices are encouraged by four important considerations:\n lower cost, 2. security, 3. no vendor \u0026lsquo;lock in\u0026rsquo; and 4. better quality. We believe that the number of data scientists in the music domain is so few that only an open collaboration can guarantee adequate data quality. (In our CEEMID documentation you find more information about the [R language](https://documentation.ceemid.eu/index.php?title=R_(programming_language) and the concept of open-source software.)  We believe that the European Music Observatory must rely on open-source statistical software written in the R statistical language like CEEMID, and it must be funded on the principle of open collaboration with the industry, public authorities and academia.\nCEEMID uses the open source statistical programming language R, and various open source R programs. CEEMID also releases some of its customary program code developed to create its indicators. This allows an open collaboration with statisticians working in national statistics authorities and in independent research institutions in the EU and globally.\nThe use of open source software and the open source R statistical language allows a continuous peer-review of data ingestion, processing, corrections and indicator creation by statisticians, data scientists and academics. Statistical products of national statistical offices, sometimes Eurostat itself, not to mention data providers that are not part of the system of national statistical offices, such as the European Audiovisual Observatory, are plagued with data errors that are corrected and amended relatively slowly. We believe that unless the European Music Observatory becomes part of Eurostat (a highly unlikely organizational scenario), it should embrace the priniciples of open collaboration in creating its indicators.\nCEEMID has been releasing some of its data processing, integration and indicator creation code on an open-source license on the Comprehensive R Archive Network, or CRAN, is a collection of sites which carry identical material, consisting of the R distribution(s), the contributed extensions, documentation for R, and binaries. (More information in our documentation.) We would like to find funding to release thousands of reproducible data sets and the reproduction code from source to end result on an open data, open collaboration basis.\nOur economic impact assessment code Our iotables package programmatically creates gross-value added, employment, taxation effect and multiplier indicators from real national accounts data for all EU countries by providing a data processing and modelling software to implement the use cases of the Eurostat Manual of Supply, Use and Input-Output Tables. It was released on rOpenGov.\nThe package was originally designed for the economic impact assessment of film production in Hungary and for the Slovak music industry. (See related publication.) With the help of this package, we can, for example, calculate the effect of 1 million euro crisis relief package on the GDP, employment and future tax receipts between car manufacturing, banking, the music industry and book publishing in all EU countries. By releasing our software code, we could compare test results on calculating economic impact indicators for the creative industries and other industries with the UK statistical office. We want to release more and more of CEEMID\u0026rsquo;s software code, so that professional statisticians can validate that they work perfectly or suggest improvements.\nCreating regional indicators Our second major open-source release makes it possible to create regional statistical time series and data panels from Eurostat\u0026rsquo;s regional data - not only for the creative industries, although our original aim was to support scientific research into book piracy in a project with IVIR at the University of Amsterdam.\nWhile national borders do not change frequently, the borders of more than 1000 European NUTS1, NUTS2 and NUTS3 regions change on average every three years. The change of regional boundaries makes time-wise comparison very difficult. Because the current statistical regulations to do not make it compulsory that member states re-cast their historical data after a boundary change, Eurostat does not contain, for example, comparable data on French or Lithuanian or Hungarian regions in the previous decade.\nCEEMID\u0026rsquo;s program code does exactly this, because it traces, and whenever possible, corrects boundary changes back till 2007. We released this very complicated program code as part of the eurostat R package within the rOpenGov initiative. This program package has tens of thousands of users in research institutions, industry and in the national statistical offices themselves.\nWe released the program code, because it requires special geostatistical knowledge, and we believe it is such a critical application that only open peer-review can guarantee its flawless and error-free work.\nFrom the Centre of Europe to the European Music Observatory Historically CEEMID started out as the Central and Eastern European Music Industry Databases out of necessity following a CISAC Good Governance Seminar for European Societies in 2013. The adoption of European single market and copyright rules, and the increased activity of competition authority and regulators required a more structured approach to set collective royalty and compensations tariffs in a region that was regarded traditionally as data-poor with lower quantity of industry and government data sources available.\nIn 2014 three societies, Artisjus, HDS and SOZA realized that need to make further efforts to modernize the way they measure their own economic impact, the economic value of their licenses to remain competitive in advocating the interests vis-?-vis domestic governments, international organizations like CISAC and GESAC and the European Union. They signed a Memorandum of Understanding with their consultant to set up the CEEMID databases and to harmonize their efforts. The decentralized, data integration strategy chosen by CEEMID however allowed a quick expansion of CEEMID to be a Pan-European data resource.\n","date":1585053000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585053000,"objectID":"2f0b55297de4aae98e9abeefb0ca343a","permalink":"/post/2020-03-24-documentation/","publishdate":"2020-03-24T13:30:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-03-24-documentation/","section":"post","summary":"The Central European Music Industry Report 2020 was updated with a technical annex that points out to the new wiki documentation website of CEEMID to make our work more accessible for designing the European Music Observatory.","tags":["CEEMID","CCI","opea data","documentation","music-observatory"],"title":"Documenting CEEMID For Open Data Use","type":"post"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal, CFA"],"categories":null,"content":"I was asked to contribute an article to the COVID-19 economic crisis series of the Hungarian business weekly and portal hgv.hu.

However, the creative and cultural industries are very well suited to play a much larger role in the national economy in the century of automation, robotization and global competition for tax revenues. We have shown in Hungary and Slovakia that the creative industries pay proportionally far more taxes and social contributions that car manufacturers and other favored industries of the 2010s.\nThere is not much that the music industry, film production can do these days. While the performances and productions are set on hold, it would be logical to send the workforce to courses, and replace the obsolete skills, or pick up new ones, but in the current crisis schooling is not possible. Furthermore, because of the same fragmentation, these industries have been lagging organizing life-long learning for the workforce, for example, because CCI enterprises usually do not even have strategic HR functions to plan and implement such programs. All we can do in this crisis is to organize online, and prepare for a more collaborative participation in the economic recovery discussion and make sure that in the next crisis the workforce will be able to participate in learning programmes.\n","date":1584552600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584955800,"objectID":"383d9e5e765adf850e2c35d11b5db887","permalink":"/post/2020-03-18-covid19/","publishdate":"2020-03-18T18:30:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-03-18-covid19/","section":"post","summary":"I was asked to contribute an article to the COVID-19 economic crisis series of the Hungarian business weekly and portal hgv.hu.

So far, about 5000 music and 1500 film professionals filled out our detailed questionnaire about their working conditions, skills, tasks. Some of our surveys were related to training needs assessments, and other professional growth assessments.\nThe ESCO system builds on occupations, skills and qualifications. Our general experience is that in the music and film industry, because of the lack of life-long learning opportunities, the absence of large employers, low level of unionization, and generally the mixed nature of occupations, informal learning practices play a very important role. Therefore, the skills and especially the qualifications pillars of the ESCO system are less helpful in their current forms.\nA very important problem with the occupations pillar is that creative workers tend to work in microenterprises without a high degree of specialization, and they tend to mix artistic professional, technician and other occupational tasks. Obviously, in these microenterprises, where there are no HR professional present, we cannot talk about job descriptions, and we devised an empirical strategy to evaluate the actual occupation of our respondents. We created industry-specific taxonomies of economic activities that we tried to map with economic activities (which came more natural in microenterprises than job descriptions), education, and occupational groups. In our surveys, we asked music and film professionals to self-identify with a primary, and an optional secondary 100 music industry specific and about 250 film industry specific role.\nThe creation of a recorded music product or a live music performance typically requires the contribution of 9-250 professionals, while a film may require 30-3000 people to produce, including almost all elements of the music output. Unsurprisingly, we found a higher level of specialization in the film industry than in the music industry, but in both industries, it was common that a creative worker’s occupation could be mapped to both an artistic professional and a technician role. The role of qualifications played a very little role, particularly in the popular music field, where most roles are anyway learned in informal learning practices. Because most creative workers work in some entrepreneurial form, we used both ESCO and NACE coding to identify their main tasks. As a starting point, we used the 5-digit national NACE economic activity descriptions of Hungary, and adjusted them in consultation with key professionals, film producers as employers and professional associations.\nWe have a large enough answer pool — sometimes proven to be representative of the country’s professional group population — that we would be able to create new occupational descriptions on an empirical basis. We are able to perform clustering of job descriptions, earnings, educational levels, and work output (such as films, documentaries, TV programmes, live music performances, music compositions, etc) to empirically create groups with a “set of jobs whose main tasks and duties are characterised by a high degree of similarity” in terms of economic activity and work output.\nIt is a well-known fact that creative economic activities require complex mapping because freelancer, micro- and small enterprises are mixing heterogenous activities that are stretching across various economic activity (NACE) classes and ESCO occupational groups.\nEmpirically, we see that creative people are usually combining various artistic roles.(The chart above is taken from the 3.2 chapter of the Central European Music Industry Report)\nThe combination of technical and artistic roles is also very frequent, and a sizeable minority combines artistic and educational, artistic and managerial or artistic and technical roles. The ‘occupation’ chosen for the workshop, i.e. ‘singer’, is a rather rare one, as the most likely artistic occupation in popular music is ‘singer-songwriter’. Singers can be found often to work in sound engineering, too. Generally, up to half of the roles that creatives are performing are combining 264-265 artistic Professional elements and the very broad 3435 Other artistic and cultural associate professionals’ roles. Furthermore, in both the music and the film industry, the general educational level can be quiet low — both industries create a lot of jobs for young, not highly-educated people —, where clerical support work elements, or elementary professions elements are mixing with either technician or artistic roles.\nOur research was not designed to identify new ESCO groups, but we believe that our data is very well suited for this. Interestingly, much of our research arrived at occupational groupings from a learning needs assessment or educational needs assessment perspective, which we believe to be very problematic in both the music and film industry. Almost all creative industry professionals in the music and film industry work in microenterprises, a small minority in small enterprises, and only a very few people in medium-sized enterprises. Micro-enterprises and small enterprises usually have no strategic HR functions, do not perform learning needs, do not offer in-house training, and do not have the ability to send workers to any regular formal training. This leads to a very wasteful human resources management, because there is a huge workforce surplus present, but at the same time, because of skills shortages, key workers are extremely overworked, and generally there is a huge structural workforce shortage present.\nFurther reading:\n ESCO handbook - European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations Central Euorpean Music Industry Report 2020  ","date":1583926200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583926200,"objectID":"68737403f7f1167a865af6cc91c040f4","permalink":"/post/2020-03-11-esco/","publishdate":"2020-03-11T12:30:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-03-11-esco/","section":"post","summary":"CEEMID has a large enough answer pool for an empirical clustering of occupations.

Our CEE Music Industry Report 2020 created with the help and support of Consolidated Independent was used as a use case for the problems.\nThis blog post is an edited version of my presentation and the subsequent panel discussion with the stakeholders and organizers.\nThe CEE Report builds on the results of the first Hungarian, Slovak, Croatian and Czech music industry reports are compared with Armenian, Austrian, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, Serbian and Slovenian data and findings.\nInvisibility The measurement problems and the ‘invisibility’ of creative and cultural industries is a consequence of the fact that these industries are predominantly comprised of microenterprises and individual, freelancing entrepreneurs. Even larger entities, such as collective management organizations can be classified as small enterprises. In the EU, small- and medium enterprises, and especially microenterprises usually have reduced reporting duties to the statistical authorities and tax authorities (which is the most important secondary source of government statistics in anonymized, aggregated form.) This means that the supply side is not visible for policymakers. The recommendation is to conduct sample-based surveys among these microenterprises, but very few member states do that.\nAnother problem is that on the demand side, not all member states create statistics. ESSNet-Culture created recommendations how to measure cultural access and participation, which is a broader term than cultural consumption, as it includes non-market forms, for example, liturgical music, amateur acting, and so on. The European Commission sometimes makes excellent, but not detailed CAP surveys, which are the most important sources of Eurostat’s relevant pan-European statistics.\nCEEMID has been making such surveys, both on the supply side (in music and film) and in the audience side (in music, film, theatre, opera, and artistic activities) in several member states, and has plenty of experience with using the EU-mandated CAP surveys of 2007 and 2013. The CEE report relies on the latter date set in first part of the audience analysis. Our work was already presented in 2015 as a best use case in Creating better national cultural statistics with Eurobarometer datasets and ESSNet-Culture technical recommendations at GESIS, which maintains the Eurobarometer archives, on the Eurobarometer Symposium Four Decades of Surveying Europe – Perspectives on Academic Research with the European Commission’s Eurobarometer Surveys\nFor the EU the lowest hanging fruit would be to critically assess the past surveys, including the partial CAP survey made in 2017 for the cultural heritage part of culture, and the national surveys conducted by CEEMID and its partners, and to mandate an annual or biannual CAP survey within the Eurobarometer series, probably as a specially sampled “Special Eurobarometer”. This would very significantly reduce the costs compared to a country-to-country basis, and probably could be shared by other institutions, for example, with the European Audiovisual Observatory. This alone would greatly increase the demand / consumption side information on the services of creative and cultural enterprises.\nIn the panel discussion Consolidated Independent highlighted the problem of leaving sample-based statistics making to the industry itself, which leads to myopical incentives to create ‘policy-based evidence’ that is cherry picked by industry trade associations to fit their often not very well thought out policy agenda. In our view, the most important role of a future European Music Observatory would be to set standards to data collection and integration. The music industry is one of the most data-rich industries globally, but the publicly available, verified, trustworthy information is scarce both for policy-making and for business planning among microenterprises who have know specialized research know-how. Our already existing, representative national surveys should and could be extended to the whole Europe with the quality control and visibility offered by such an Observatory.\nIndustry organization A very significant challenge with evidence-based policymaking, or, in fact, with any policy making is that the extremely fragmented nature of the industry makes national and EU-level consultations very difficult. Most of the workforce is neither a classical employer nor employee but works as a freelancer or a micro-entrepreneur. Their views are very rarely represented by trade unions or employee associations or chambers of commerce. Despite all efforts on EU level to make the social dialogue more representative for atypical and flexible work forms, the problems and the views of the creative and cultural sectors are largely unrepresented in policy debate.\nA prime example of this problem is the very heavy over-taxation of the music industry that we have shown in the Hungarian and Slovak national music industry reports, and in other documents in Croatia. The problem is not only characteristic for the music industry, but generally all CCIs because they share similar economic properties: no real chance to use tax breaks, high level of labour input and high level of value added. While policy makers and granting authorities spend much time on trying to improve the financing of this sector, in fact, reducing over-taxation would make a much more imminent impact on the liquidity, profitability and growth opportunities of the sector.\nHowever, in the making of economic and tax policies, the fragmented creative and cultural industries hardly can represent their special situation.\nPolicy issues Apart from taxation issues, which significantly reduce the liquidity, profitability and growth opportunities of these sectors in many EU countries, particularly in the CEE, where corporate taxes are low but value-added taxes are high, there are other important policy problem that reduce the long-term growth capacity of the sector.\nThe very small enterprise size leads to missing strategic human resources (HR) and research and development (R\u0026amp;D) functions in almost all enterprises – including simple market research activities. Companies with 1-2 employees do not have specialized management and support functions, and thus they have a very strong handicap in HR and R\u0026amp;D.\nA good example of this problem is the motion picture and TV industry. These industries were comprised of medium-sized enterprises in the 1980s with significant in-house education functions. The current structure of these industries, however, resembles music, with almost all enterprises staying below the 5-person threshold. In our experience, based on development needs assessments in the Hungarian motion picture and the Czech music industry, this creates an acute skills and labor shortage. Missing skills cannot be well replaced by recruitment, or with strategic HR development via life-long learning.\nSimilarly to very reduced opportunities to participate in, and create life-long learning schemes, there are very little chances to engage in market research and R\u0026amp;D. While the music industry, for example, is one of the most data-driven industries in the world, the microenterprise size does not allow that these enterprises commission market research or hire data scientists. This leads to very asymmetrical relationships with the main distributors of music and media content on platforms that are owned by global data companies.\nRecommendations I made a few concrete recommendations in the panel.\n  Creating the European Music Observatory, and the creation of similar industry initiatives, and commissioning collaborative (multi-stakeholder) market research, as CEEMID works in many countries, can only replace the missing market research function in the extremely fragmented industries, such as motion picture production, the music industry, but to a certain degree architecture and design.\n  A low-hanging fruit would be a critical assessment of the previous Pan-European CAP surveys and the comparable national CAP surveys conducted by CEEMID and its partners following the ESSNet Culture recommendations and the inclusion of the CAP surveys in an annual or bi-annual form in the Eurobarometer (Special) series. A Special Eurobarometer may be more suitable because usually a non-proportional weighting of the sample gives the best value for money in these surveys.\n  Critically reviewing the participation of micro-enterprises in the current forms of social dialogue and looking for formal or informal ways to increase participation in policy making can gradually lead to more creative-friendly economic regulation and tax policies. The Hungarian Music Industry Report 2015 and the Slovak Music Industry Report 2019 contains very interesting case studies for this problem that we briefly summarize in the CEE Music Industry Report 2020.\n  Critically reviewing the few examples from mainly Nordic member states where collective agreements and other collaborative institutions allow microenterprises and freelancers to participate in life-long learning problems can help designing policies that will gradually reduce the huge skill gap of the CCIs in management know-how, data know-how, or renew their technical skills necessary in the production of their services and content. Our work with the Hungarian National Film Fund and surveys among more than a thousand film makers can give much insight into this problem.\n  Further links Our research findings were earlier presented and discussed in Vienna, Prague, Budapest and Bratislava with stakeholders.\nYou can follow Creative FLIP project on Twitter.\n","date":1580310000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580310000,"objectID":"e16a23b156aca94ce649126c85162b8d","permalink":"/post/2020-01-30-ceereport/","publishdate":"2020-01-29T16:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-01-30-ceereport/","section":"post","summary":"The Central \u0026 Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020 was presented as a case-study on national and comparative evidence-based policymaking in the cultural and creative sector.","tags":["market-report","music-industry","CCI","CEEMID","opendata","Armenia","Austria","Bulgaria","Czechia","Lithuania","Hungary","Slovakia","Serbia"],"title":"CCS Ecosystems: Evidence-Driven CCI Policy \u0026 The Central \u0026 Eastern European Music Industry Report","type":"post"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal"],"categories":null,"content":"CEEMID \u0026amp; Consolidated Independent presented and discussed with stakeholders the Central \u0026amp; Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020 as a case-study on national and comparative evidence-based policymaking in the cultural and creative sector on the CCS Ecosystems: FLIPPING THE ODDS Conference – a two-day high-level stakeholder event jointly organized by Geothe-Institute and the DG Education and Culture of the European Commission with the Creative FLIP project.\nThe CEE Report builds on the results of the first Hungarian, Slovak, Croatian and Czech music industry reports are compared with Armenian, Austrian, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, Serbian and Slovenian data and findings.\nOur research findings were earlier presented and discussed in Vienna, Prague, Budapest and Bratislava with stakeholders.\nYou can find the earlier presentations in the blog section of the website.\nExecutive Summary The first Central European Music Industry Report is the result of a co-operation that started among stakeholders in three EU countries five years ago to measure the economic value added of music – the basis of a modern royalty pricing system. This gave birth to CEEMID, originally the Central \u0026amp; Eastern European Music Industry Databases, a data integration programme that now in 2020, covers all of Europe. CEEMID fulfils similar roles to the planned European Music Observatory and supports all pillars of the future pan-European system.\nThe comparison of Western and Eastern music audiences reveals key demographic differences that make the unchanged adoption of business practices from mature markets in the region questionable. Chapter 2 of this report will show these differences and their consequences on music markets, in terms of visiting and acquisition likelihood, frequency, seasonality and purchasing capacity. This is an example of how CEEMID fulfils the role of Pillar 3 (music, society and citizenship) in the planned European Music Observatory.\nChapter 3 contrasts market demand with the supply strategies of musicians. CEEMID has been surveying music professionals, including artists, technicians and managers about their working conditions, market conditions and plans for five years across a growing number of countries. In 2019 we invited 100 national and regional stakeholders to distribute our surveys. In some countries, our surveys already have several years of historic data, making the resulting musician database probably the largest ever source of data about how music is produced and how musicians live. We are constantly looking for partners to roll out this survey to new countries in new languages.\nThe CEE region has comparative advantages in big music events like festivals, and it has become one of the most important hubs for cultural tourism in the world. We explain this phenomenon in Chapter 4 by showing the differences in demand composition, demography and supply of venues in the second chapter. The lack of a modern and dense network of permanent music venues gave rise to magnificent music festivals in the CEE. Open’er, Sziget and Exit are among the biggest and best festivals in the world, closely followed by several smaller festivals in all countries. The share of festivals in the live music market is many times higher than in Western Europe and they provide vital export revenues to the local music economies. However, they play a limited role in finding new audiences for local artists, as they are increasingly programming for Western audiences by providing shows of international hits. They can only very partially fill in the gaps left by the small venue problem that hit the emerging markets harder than the UK or Australia, where policy action had been already taken to reverse the decline of the availability of smaller live music venues.\nOn the recording side, our analysis shows that modern digital services are growing at a faster rate than in mature markets. Because of lower repertoire competition, streaming quantities are similar for a typical Austrian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish or Slovak track than in the mature markets. However, revenue growth is limited because of the interplay of several analysed factors. Our analysis of the live and recorded music markets shows that CEEMID fulfils the roles of the Pillar 1 (music economy) of the planned European Music Observatory.\nMost recorded music sales revenue in the region comes from streaming platforms, just like in the mature markets. Successful sales strategies require a solid knowledge of the global marketplace and the ability to understand and train sales algorithms. Micro-enterprises, such as independent labels, have very limited ability to cope with these functions, given that they do not have market research or R\u0026amp;D functions. CEEMID and Consolidated Independent have started initiating open, national R\u0026amp;D consortia to create the necessary concentration in data assets, analytical capacity and budgets to close this gap. As a first step, CEEMID and Consolidated Independent have created a large, independent music dataset based on hundreds of millions of royalty statement entries to create our market indexes, styled after stock market and bond market indexes. Streaming opportunities are fast changing as roll-out of streaming services is happening at a different rate in various territories; subscription charges and the exchange rate to the producer’s currency vary and repertoire competition emerges in the market. Our volume and revenue indexes in Chapter 5.3 are aimed at creating sales algorithms that optimize sales volumes and expected revenues. We believe that this analysis also reveals that CEEMID partially fulfils the roles of Pillar 2 (music diversity and circulation) and feeds important data into Pillar 4 (innovation).\nThe region has far bigger untapped potential than most music business executives believe. Households in the region spend a significantly lower share of their recreational budget on music than their Western, Southern or Nordic peers. The region has a lot of untapped cultural purchasing power because servicing is particularly challenging in both the live and recorded sides of the business.\nThis upside potential cannot be tapped without better pricing. Royalty levels are often very low in the region. Due to many combined effects analysed in this short report, the gap between royalties earned in the CEE and Western Europe is several times bigger than the difference in GDP or national average wage. These gaps are partly caused by special interests preventing collective management from charging appropriate tariffs for restaurants, media companies or electronic appliance importers and manufacturers, and partly by unfavourable taxation of cultural products and services.\nCEEMID was designed to create economic evidence on royalty pricing, private copying compensation and the creation of economic value added in the industry. In the first Hungarian Music Industry Report of ProArt and in the first Slovak Music Industry Report we have shown that economic and taxation policies of the CEE countries aimed to support car and electronics manufacturing create a distorted, unfavourable economic regime for creative industries. We want to help local stakeholders with economic evidence to correct these discriminatory policies during the overhaul of the EU VAT system. We have been helping various national organizations with economic evidence, presented in the light of latest EU jurisprudence, to improve their pricing activities. Our thousands of indicators were also used in ex ante evaluations of granting schemes.\nIn 2020, all EU member states will change their copyright administration legislation because of the national implementations of the 2019/790 Digital Single Market directive. CEEMID provides evidence in several countries about the size and impact mechanism of the value transfer, and generally the widespread use of the copyright exemption for private copying. We believe that the thousands of pan-European music industry indicators that we have aggregated over the five years will play a vital role in these regulatory processes.\nCEEMID fulfils its roles with a very thorough exploitation of the EU’s 17-years-old Open Data regime with the re-use of public sector information, and a very careful mapping of the music industry. These maps help us conduct annual surveys among musicians and the audience, and they help us connect (always with pre-approval and with a user mandate) to industry databases. We do not only cover the EU countries, but increasingly (potential) candidate countries and neighbourhood countries.\nIn our vision, this data collection and integration, i.e. Pillars 1-3 should be available for all music stakeholders, should remain public and publicly funded. The last Pillar of the observatory, innovation, is where private entities should compete. The founders of CEEMID and Consolidated Independent believe that this report demonstrates the business and policy benefits of such a system with the analysis of the Central \u0026amp; Eastern European music markets. We believe that this way CEEMID is in a position to serve most of the planned functions of the envisioned European Music Observatory, and we are looking for ways to make either our thousands of indicators, or our data collection and integration software open source and available for all stakeholders in the EU and its neighbours. CEEMID was born out of necessity to level out the different levels of public research and statistical coverage of the EU member states. In our view, private entities in the future should focus their investments in Pillar 4 of the planned observatory, i.e. competing in innovation with creating new models, algorithms and services based on data that is available throughout the European Union without giving further advantage to the already mature markets.\n","date":1580310000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580310000,"objectID":"5ee96ab1e81941d29fc0164f71dc9a4b","permalink":"/publication/ceereport_2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-29T16:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ceereport_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The results of the first Hungarian, Slovak, Croatian and Czech music industry reports are compared with Armenian, Austrian, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, Serbian and Slovenian data and findings.","tags":["market-report","music-industry","Armenia","Austria","Bulgaria","Czechia","Lithuania","Hungary","Slovakia","Serbia"],"title":"Central \u0026 Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal, CFA"],"categories":null,"content":"CEEMID \u0026amp; Consolidated Independent will present to the audience the Central European Music Industry Report 2020 (will be availale in all formats on the presentation day) on the CCS Ecosystems: FLIPPING THE ODDS Conference – a two-day high-level stakeholder event jointly organized by Geothe-Institute and the DG Education and Culture of the European Commission with the Creative FLIP project.\nCreative FLIP stands for Finance, Learning, Innovation and Patenting is a Pilot project co-funded by the EU whose main objective is to support healthy and sustainable ecosystems for Cultural and Creative Industries (CCIs) with respect to these four key policy areas.\nExecutive Summary The first Central European Music Industry Report is the result of a co-operation that started among stakeholders in three EU countries five years ago to measure the economic value added of music – the basis of a modern royalty pricing system.

In popular music performers usually play their own composition and sing their own lyrics. If the musician is self-published, all the three royalties directly pay the artist’s work. If a professional publisher is helping the artist as a composer, or a record producer as a recorded performer, they usually share the respective royalty revenues. In emerging markets fewer, in mature markets more composers are represented by publishers and performers by record labels.\nClassification of Industries The nature of the creative jobs is that they contain a wide range of activities. Economists and government policymakers classify industries with the Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans la Communauté européenne, in short, with the NACE classification in Europe. This classification is largely harmonized on UN level and can be used to compare almost all economies in the world. The NACE classification has its origins in the economic structure of the middle 20th century, and it is more appropriate for the classification of manufacturing and trading activities, such as car manufacturing, or retail sale of cars.\nThe music industry is not even recognized by the NACE classification. For example, musicians often perform music (NACE group 90), compose music (NACE group 90), and at the same time do sound recordings (NACE group 58) and teach music (NACE group 85). Many EU member states do not even create government economic statistics for the NACE 90 classes.\nThis is the main reason why music is not well represented in governmental statistics, which is mainly based on tax returns data from ‘clear’ activity groups, such as sound recordings only. Most creative enterprises, and music businesses are no excemptions, do not have a clear economic activity.\nMicroenterprises \u0026amp; Freelancers The music industry, for various reasons, is not part of the NACE industry, and music industry data must be mapped from different data sources. A further difficulty is that music industry, similarly to the other creative and cultural industries, mainly works in freelancer networks and microenterprises. All over Europe, microenterprises are exempted from many statistical reporting, and they are filing simplified tax and financial reports.\nThe government statistics are largely based on tax returns and other filings of corporate entities with at least 5 employees. While most manufacturing or trading activities, or licensed service activities such as insurance or banking, are easy to classify, the creative industries are different. Because most creative enterprises are smaller than 5 people, they do not file many data for the government or the tax authorities, and they often carry out heterogeneous activities. For example, the music industry is not even recognized by the NACE classification – the live music and compositions can be found in the NACE 90 class, and the sound recordings in the NACE 58 class, and many countries do not even create government economic statistics for the NACE 90 classes.\nStandardized mapping CEEMID has been mapping data sources for composer, producer and performer royalties, and other data sources since 2014, based on the standard mapping technique developed originally in the United States and later adopted to the EU ^[Hull, Geoffrey P., Thomas W.

Over the course of 6 years we collected anonymous data among musicians related to their touring habits, income, costs, recording expenses and income in various channels.\nAbout 100 stakeholders, among them many collective management organizations helped our work. Some collective management organizations provided us with anonymous payout lists, which was essential to validate the representativeness of our samples. We reconstructed the density function of actual payouts, and collected data until our anonymous responses showed a very accurately similar shape.\nBecause the music industry all over Europe is mainly made of microenterprise and freelancers, getting an overal picture of the music industry is very difficult.\n","date":1575532800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575532800,"objectID":"577f8916feeb06635f484caa65e4b2c8","permalink":"/usecase/music_industry_mapping/","publishdate":"2019-12-05T09:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/usecase/music_industry_mapping/","section":"usecase","summary":"The copyright and neighboring right royalty is the wage-like earning of the music performer, the composer and producer.

In the absence of a fully functional recording market, musicians are more reliant on collective management revenues than in the rest of Europe – yet in many countries collective management has profound difficulty in asking the correct price for music or collecting it.\nWhen analysing the music flows among European countries, and the export-import flows of other emerging markets in Latin America and the worlds most stable ones, like that of the United States, Brazil and Japan, we must realize that these nations face an uphill battle to get into the better paying markets and at the same time to protect their domestic market from increasing import substitution.\nMusic grants could be an important tool to balance the disadvantaged position of CEE musicians in this global competition. Austria and Hungary has a strong popular music support program, but usually the availability and suitability of grants is lower in those countries where musicians and their technical and managerial team would need it most.\n I am very grateful for the support given by Consolidated Independent in the making of this report. CI is the market leader in managed services for the digital music industry, connecting the best independent music with the opportunities of the global market. With their data science team, we put together data from about 700,000,000 royalty statement documents about the whole region.

I always felt that however dynamic are those charts, artists keep complaining that they do not feel these developments. So I started to decompose those growth figures.\nThe Global Music Report quotes national streaming revenues on a dollar basis, which contains a lot of currency exchange noise. And behind the national total there are too many factors: subscriber base growth and repertoire growth and the subscription fee. The interplay of these forces is unpredictable. Whenever a local artist or producers sees a 10% reported national growth, they can never be sure if this will likely cause their sale to grow or shrink.\nBecause of the changes in the subscriber base and the available competing repertoire, it is important to see if the artist’s segment is growing, and if the competition is growing. The sales platforms will never reveal such data, and anyway, there is a competition among many sales platforms. I was looking for an analogy for a similar problem. Securities are a bit similar to songs, they will produce later cash flows, and they are competing for an always changing number of investors and with a constantly changing competition in the investible universe. Songs and their royalty flows exhibit similarities with both equity and bonds, and I believe that a good solution is the creation of song indexes, similarly to stock and bond indexes that represent the performance of various security classes. After many hours of work with the state51 data science team, and at least as much processing work for the servers, we came up with a dataset that contained data from about 700 million royalty statements. I designed a sampling method that is far from perfect, but I think it gives a first birds-eye view on the European markets.\nIn every country and every month, we selected those exploited songs that were in the middle of the exploitation range: as many songs were less listened to as many were more listened too. For simplicity, I call those selected songs the ‘typical songs’ for each streaming platform and royalty territory. I added together the streaming quantities on the three major platforms. For every territory and month, this could have been the sales of a ‘typical’ song.\nLike stock and bond indexes, we can create even more relevant indexes for certain rightsholders. In the Central European Music Industry Report, we will present for each territory a ‘domestic’ and a ‘foreign’ index, because the sales potential of a Slovak song in Slovakia or in Austria is very different from a British song in Slovakia or Austria. In Slovakia, a Slovak song is on a home territory and in Austria in a near territory, while the British song is on one of the almost 200 territories.\nThese findings will be open to discussion on Waves Music Showcase Festival and Conference [click for details] on 27 September 2019.\n","date":1569258000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569258000,"objectID":"1b0a652f07d2ebcfe645c31b86137020","permalink":"/post/2019-09-24_index/","publishdate":"2019-09-23T19:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2019-09-24_index/","section":"post","summary":"Total national sales reflect the growing number of subscribers, the price, the exchange rate, and many factors that are not important for an artists or music label.

For comparison, we added a similar, middle-income emerging market (Argentina) and a rich, small-population English-speaking country, Australia to the chart. These countries seem to be in a similar position to the CEE countries.\nArguably, the strongest countries of songwriting are the United States and Brazil - these are the countries that have ran out of the ISRC recording identifier range. Their charts are full with their domestic songs, but they are not alone. Japan, France, and the bigger EU countries, France, Germany and Poland have very strong domestic performance, too.\nOf course, there are many factor at play here. Large countries with large artist populations generate a lot more recordings, so they local fans always have thousands of new songs to select from. In small countries, the total annual creations, from pop to jazz, from authentic folk to classical amounts to a few thousand tracks. But it is not only size that matters. Sweden\u0026rsquo;s population is similar to that of Austria, Hungary and Czechia, yet the Swedish repertoire performs better in Sweden, and as we will see in the next chart, abroad, too.\nWe created a second data animation to visualize how hits were travelling across the borders in the summer of 2ö19. To make the chart easier to read, we omitted the United States, Brazil and Japan as countries of origin, and concentrated only on intra-European hit flows.\nThe second week of September 2019 was not an exceptional week. Most EU countries\u0026rsquo; producers did not score any hits in any other EU countries\u0026rsquo; Spotify Top 50 hits. The UK exported many great hits to all over Europe, as usual, but there were other important hit flows. These hits mainly follow cultural proximity.\nFrance exported hits to the two Francophone countries of Europe, Belgium and Romania, and furthermore to Greece, a Southern country with particularly unique chart composition. Germany exported many hits to Austria, another German-speaking country, and some hits to other Germanic countries. Dutch producers placed a few hits in the Germanic countries and in Belgium, where the Dutch-speaking Flemish community has its own radios, TVs, press and hitlists. The Netherlands is a powerhouse of electronic popmusic that are not bound by language which finds audience in several countries.\nThe strength and competitive position of the national market where an artists is most known and has a fan base is usually a determining factor of track performance and revenue. The overall revenue prospects and competition situation of a Hungarian or Croatian song is very different from a British or even a Polish song. But overall, most European recordings are not bound to a domestic country. Because of cultural proximity, the presence of native minorities or new immigrant diasporas, even small-language songs are being listened to on a much wider territory than the artists\u0026rsquo; original country. Some relatively small EU countries, such as Sweden and the Netherlands successfully export their music on a regular basis.\nNevertheless, as the streaming services slowly overtake all other forms of use, the charts above depict a very fundamental market change. Whereas in the traditional channels of physical sales, digital downloads and broadcasting, the CEE countries, like other small- and medium-sized EU countries, enjoyed 30-50% market share, among the streaming hits their producer\u0026rsquo;s share is below 10%. It is not unusual to find only domestic recordings in physical sales hitlists, while domestic songs rarely enter the streaming charts in the region, with the exception of Poland.\nThe traditional sales channels protected CEE markets in several ways. After EU accession most import duties are gone, but physical products have very significant logistics costs, which gives local producers a competitive edge. Because physical products are increasingly sold on concerts and festivals, where the market share of domestic performers is usually very high, the traditional, mechanically licensed sales had a protected market.\nThe broadcasting channel, which used the be the most important promotion channel, too, was protected in many European countries by national content quotas, or supported with generously funded national, regional, local public broadcasters who gave a preference to national composers, producers and performers.

This is a very good starting point because it makes comparable the rough material standards of musicians and other professional groups in the EU, irrespective of local earnings and living costs.\nMusicians everywhere, including rich countries like Germany, Austria and Slovenia have more problems with paying their bills than the general population in their countries. The only seemingly different country is Bulgaria, but in this case, the self-reported difference is small, and generally Bulgarian musicians and other Bulgarian people have similarly frequent difficulties with paying their bills.\nWorking in an emerging economy is more stressful than in a mature economy – making ends is more difficult, risks are greater and usually rules change faster. No wonder that people generally report higher level of life satisfaction in countries where the living standards are also higher: average life satisfaction in a country is greatly influenced by national income and general health level, measured by life expectancy. However, it is also recorded since the 1970s that after reaching a certain level of living standards, life satisfaction does not increase further with economic conditions. Other factors, such as vocation, work-life balance and political factors play a role, too. Working in an emerging economy is more stressful than in a mature economy – making ends is more difficult, risks are greater and usually rules change faster.\nIn the emerging music business countries, it is very important to see that the musicians not only earn little money, but as freelancers their income is mainly based on live performances, peaking in the festival season and in December. This income is usually taxed at far higher rates in the CEE region than in Western Europe or in non-creative industries. Royalties, which should balance variable live performance earnings are far lower both as a percentage of total musician income and in euro terms than in advanced markets. This is often coupled with higher taxation, too.\nTo avoid the bias of higher satisfaction levels in richer environments, we measure musician’s self-reported life satisfaction levels against the national averages from the 2018/11 Eurobarometer sample, scaled between the numerical values of -2 (not at all satisfied) to 2 (very satisfied).\n\rComparing the life satisfaction levels of musicians with the general public, 2018-2019.\r\r Our comparison shows that in most of our surveyed countries, musicians are more satisfied with their lives than the average person, despite having more material difficulties. Of course, age, and other factors can contribute to this, but a vocational calling is certainly an important aspect, too. The exceptions are, interestingly, Austria and Slovenia, where the general population has a very high level of life satisfaction, and where both musicians and the general public are generally more satisfied with their lives than in the other countries. In these cases, compared to the general population, music professional are less satisfied with their lives. In Serbia our sample is too small to draw real conclusions.\n\rComparing the difficulties of paying bills among musicians and the general public, 2018-2019.\r\r Career in music can lead to higher life satisfaction than other similarly paid jobs in Europe. However, music market stakeholders should focus on increasing the level of music professional earnings and reducing its variance within the year and over the years, because the material living conditions of musicians is significantly worse than the conditions of the general population.\nYou can read a lot more about this research here.\n","date":1563724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563731100,"objectID":"1279a4eee87d94ebec00011390cd1eb0","permalink":"/post/2019-07-21_life_sat_19/","publishdate":"2019-07-21T18:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2019-07-21_life_sat_19/","section":"post","summary":"Career in music can lead to higher life satisfaction than other similarly paid jobs in Europe.

According to our research, the value of private copying is far bigger these days than when most CEE private copying remuneration mechanisms were set up.\nWhile the new DSM Directive is not addressing these issues, it is aiming to re-arrange the power balance between users and rightsholders of certain unlicensed, or not fully-licensed and compensated uses. We see common threats and common opportunities with the national implementations of the European legislation. Especially in the CEE region, many harware manufacturers who enjoy the benefits of the earlier regime will lobby their governments to dampen the affects of the directive. Worse still, as it will re-open the national copyright legislation in all EU countries, there will be renewed pressure from hardware manufacturers, telecom companies and Pirate Parties to minimalize the private copying remuneration. Google/YouTube/Alphabet is likely to place previously unseen, coordinated pressure on each country to minimize the value transfer compensation and at the same time minimize or abolish private copying remuneration - in all EU capitals from Sofia to Paris, from Den Haag to Prague.\n\r However, in many countries, no serious PCR regimes were created after the EU accession. In these countries, according to our calculations, only 10-30% or even less of the equitable remuneration is collected due to legal constraints.\nIf the changes initiated by the DSM Directive will be watered down, and equitable private copying remuneration will not be helped by new legislation, the music industries of these countries will conserve their huge gap compared to mature EU markets for further decades. If they follow the lead of those countries that made significant progres in this field, they can make a big step to close that gap. This will require fact-based, rational, effective adovacy material that can convince the general public, the media, legislators, and when necessary, judges about the position of the music industry.\n","date":1563289200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563289200,"objectID":"7083497e4140951d02b2677fc72d9dcc","permalink":"/post/2019-07-16_dsm_pcr_19/","publishdate":"2019-07-16T17:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2019-07-16_dsm_pcr_19/","section":"post","summary":"We see common threats and common opportunities with the national implementations of the DSM Directive.

In recorded music, the author, the performer and the producer are eligible for copyright and neighboring right royalties. In live music, the author and the performer are eligible for revenues, and they may or may not have a different nationality, and the concert promoter and booking manager may earn profits in another country.\nFinding out the domestic country for the author, the performer and the producer may be a very difficult task. While language is very important in most genres of popular music and in world music, language affiliation is usually a help only in small nation repertoires. But the language of a song is so important that it may be the target variable of cultural policy tools such as radio or audiovisual quotas. In classical and world music, the author may not be known or eligible for royalties anymore. In popular music and some jazz, the author and performer are usually the same artists. Nevertheless, the complexity remains. In contemporary classical music, jazz and some genres of popular music, language is not an issue because the music is instrumental, or the human voice has no real natural language connection.\nMusic Export \u0026amp; Music Import In our view, music export and music import cannot be separated from each other. Every single European market is a net importer of recorded music, given that there are no music markets where the domestic music market share exceeds 50%. In live music, domestic music traditionally is market leader in all markets, but the concentration of ticket revenues in large arena concerts and the growth of festivals is threatening the positions of domestic live music. The competition among songs, label and national repertoires is increasing very significantly with the rise of global streaming.\nIn the recorded markets, radio and audiovisual quotas and an activist role of public broadcasters could maintain a 15-30 percent market share for local artists even in smaller markets. The rise of music streaming and SVOD streaming in audiovisual works makes many of these gatekeepers irrelevant unless they find their audience and role in the new streaming channels.\nIn the live performances, some countries, especially Hungary, Serbia, Croatia and Poland found ways to create very significant export revenues for programming large festivals aimed at Western European audiences. While these solutions create vital export revenues for the music ecosystem, i.e. for promoters and technicians, it creates less opportunity for local artists. There is a growing pressure on domestic bands to extend their tour network abroad, given that the depth of domestic tour network is shrinking due to global and EU-wide small venue problem.\nArtificial intelligence and algorithms In the 21st century the total global repertoire of the last 60 years is in simultaneous competition with each other. Close to 100 million sound recordings are available in most markets. In this global competition, most music is sold by AI algorithms.\nHow CEEMID intelligence can help?   Teach new algorithms that help defending the declining domestic markets, and recommend vibrant, new local music to local audiences, and connect them on live performances, too;\n  Extend market insight and tour scheduling for the whole European market, with cost, audience demography, audience taste, revenue forecast intelligence;\n  Design quota schemes and public broadcaster strategies that maintain the public mandate in the 21st century;\n  Design music grants that give the correct incentives to the right people. Help both foreign market reach and domestic market cultivation with correct ex ante and ex post evaluations;\n  Given the complexity of the concept of ‘music export’ in the context of cultural affiliation, language, artist residence, potential separation of composer, performer and producer, music export and import is a difficult topic that requires professional, fact-driven advocacy.\n  ","date":1563282000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563282000,"objectID":"68c2af34f5eb76effc662fbf083d3593","permalink":"/usecase/music_export/","publishdate":"2019-07-16T15:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/usecase/music_export/","section":"usecase","summary":"Music export is complicated to define, because music has a live and recorded element.

Most musicians do not only fulfill the artistic role of a performer, composer, lyricist or composer. In most cases, artists perform two artistic roles, but it is equally frequent that they perform a different, but still music related engineering, educator or managerial role. Given that that average size of creative enterprises in Europe is less than two people, musicians are forced to do several very different things. In the 20th century, larger companies, especially record labels had the necessary marketing, management, engineering staff to take care of this issues, but in the 21st century most musicians need to master all of these skills to a certain extent – at least to the extent that they can hire other, mainly freelance music professionals to help them out.\nThe reason why official labor statistics and economic statistics do not capture the performance of the music business well is that the classification of economic statistics dates to the 1960s. Two key elements of a popular musician’s work, live performances and sound recordings are in different economic classes. Composer-performers, the typical musicians of popular music do not fit into this categorization. Adding to this complexity the frequent presence of other artistic, technical, managerial or educational functions makes a musician’s work hard to categorize.\nThe complexity of musician’s work makes professional training very challenging, too. Popular music throughout the world is mainly learned in informal settings. However, this is not the ideal setting to learn the necessary managerial, economic, legal and other skills that are necessary to fulfil the freelance job of a professional musician.\nThe Three Income Stream Model of the Music Industry The three income streams model is essentially a value chain based model that was developed in the United States and adopted by the European Commission’s Joint Research Center for European CCI policy purposes. We made minor adaptations in the three income model for applicability in less developed markets in Central and Eastern Europe.\nWhile in the original American model sound recordings are the “main” income stream, currently, especially in Central Europe the live performance stream earns the most income for a typical musician. The author’s stream is the oldest, traditionally and analytically first part of the music industry that includes revenue streams based on musical works exploited by music publishers and via author’s CMO societies such as SOZA. In the US it is called the publishing stream, but in Central Europe it is dominated by authors’ societies, so we modified the label.\n","date":1559912400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559998800,"objectID":"bd66d14d9be087df2ea357d53a6539bf","permalink":"/post/2019-06-07_ceemid_survey/","publishdate":"2019-06-07T15:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2019-06-07_ceemid_survey/","section":"post","summary":"Since most music professional work in microenterprises, or as freelancers, they usually do not participate in economic statistical surveys, and their problems remain hidden from government officials and the general public.

The adoption of European single market and copyright rules, and the increased activity of competition authority and regulators required a more structured approach to set collective royalty and compensations tariffs in a region that was regarded traditionally as data-poor with lower quantitiy of industry and government data sources available.\nIn 2014 three societies, Artisjus, HDS and SOZA realized that need to make further efforts to modernize the way they measure their own economic impact, the economic value of their licenses to remain competitive in advocating the interests vis-à-vis domestic governments, international organizations like CISAC and GESAC and the European Union. They signed a Memorandum of Understanding with their consultant to set up the CEEMID databases and to harmonize their efforts.\nCEEMID by designed aimed to follow the best European practices on statistical harmonization and was already featured as an innovative best practice in the 40th anniversary of Pan European Surveying seminar in 2015. As an initiative born out of necessity, it aimed fill in the gaps of underdeveloped official cultural statics by following the guidelines of Eurostat\u0026rsquo;s ESSNet.\nWe believe that a very large segment of CEEMID\u0026rsquo;s and the European Music Observatory\u0026rsquo;s data coverage is based on public-interest data that is collected by public authorities. Therefore, CEEMID was based on the regulatory framework provided by the Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information provides a common legal framework for a European market for government-held data (public sector information). It a regulatory framework that is built around two key pillars of the internal market: transparency and fair competition. In our view, these principles should apply to European Music Observatory, too.\nOpen source, open data, open collaboration In the EU, open data is governed by the Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information - in short: Open Data Directive (EU) 2019 / 1024. It entered into force on 16 July 2019. It replaces the Public Sector Information Directive, also known as the ‘PSI Directive’ which dated from 2003 and was subsequently amended in 2013. The founder of CEEMID, Daniel Antal has been involved in Open Data and PSI since 2008.\nWe believe that the European Music Observatory must rely on open-source statistical software written in the R statistical language like CEEMID. (Read why.)\nCEEMID uses the open source statistical programming language R, and various open source R programs. CEEMID also releases some of its customary program code developed to create its indicators (See open data on this site). This allows an open collaboration with statisticians working in national statistics authorities and in independent research institutions in the EU and globally. For example, this allowed us to compare test results on calculating economic impact indicators for the creative industries and other industries with the UK statistical office.\nThe use of open source software and the open source R statistical language allows a continuous peer-review of data ingestion, processing, corrections and indicator creation by statisticians, data scientists and academics. Statistical products of national statistical offices, sometimes Eurostat itself, not to mention data providers that are not part of the system of national statistical offices, such as the European Audiovisual Observatory, are plagued with data errors that are corrected and amended relatively slowly.\nData integration instead of centralisation From the originally envisioned, centralized, permission-based data structure, due to practical considerations, CEEMID switched to a more flexible, decentralized approach. This approach is based on continuous data integration, which requires permissions to use business confidential information only in use. This allowed a rapid extension of CEEMID to the whole of Europe and go even beyond. As a result of continous data integration it already includes hundreds of indicators foreseen in all pillars of the planned European Music Observatory.\nWhile CEEMID is aware of and uses the metadata of CISAC\u0026rsquo;s, IFPI\u0026rsquo;s, EAO\u0026rsquo;s, and other industry sources\u0026rsquo; data, it does not contain this data, only when a user with permission for the use of these industry sources requires the integration of such data with other CEEMID data, or user-specific data. While this approach makes sharing results more cumbersome, it provided a path to increase the number of useful indicators from a few dozens to around a thousand. Furthermore, it exponentially increases the value of CISAC\u0026rsquo;s, IFPI\u0026rsquo;s or EAO\u0026rsquo;s data, especially when designing better royalty rates, or creating economic evidence for litigation. Take a look at a simple, non-confidential example blog post.\nThe CEEMID Music Professional Surveys are anonymous surveys about the live music and recording markets and granting schemes. The surveys have been filled out by about 4000 musicians, technicians, managers (and 2000 filmmakers) about the tour destinations, concert budgets and average audiences, various royalty receipts from streaming services, physical and digital sales, YouTube, Bandcamp. We are also creating comparable statistics with all EU national statistics on life satisfaction, economic expectations, income and economic situation and other characteristics of music and filmmaker professionals.\nCEEMID makes sure that the Client\u0026rsquo;s data (collective management organizations, music distributors, music export offices, music granting agencies) are correctly integrated with our survey data, statistical and big data sources, with industry data and the Client\u0026rsquo;s own transactional financial, licensing, granting or processed data. We are handling professionally data errors, missing data, currency translations and other problem areas.\nData sources   Nationally representative CAP surveys of music users and film viewers.\n  Anonymous CEEMID Music Professional Surveys and CEEMID Audiovisual Professional Surveys about their work, incomes and costs.

See example blog post\n  The Future of CEEMID Historically CEEMID started out as the Central and Eastern European Music Industry Databases out of necessity following a CISAC Good Governance Seminar for European Societies in 2013. The adoption of European single market and copyright rules, and the increased activity of competition authority and regulators required a more structured approach to set collective royalty and compensations tariffs in a region that was regarded traditionally as data-poor with lower quantity of industry and government data sources available.\nIn 2014 three societies, Artisjus, HDS and SOZA realized that need to make further efforts to modernize the way they measure their own economic impact, the economic value of their licenses to remain competitive in advocating the interests vis-à-vis domestic governments, international organizations like CISAC and GESAC and the European Union. They signed a Memorandum of Understanding with their consultant to set up the CEEMID databases and to harmonize their efforts. The adoption of European single market and copyright rules, and the increased activity of competition authority and regulators required a more structured approach to set collective royalty and compensations tariffs in a region that was regarded traditionally as data-poor with lower quantitiy of industry and government data sources available, but quickly covered the whole European area (Read more about our data coverage and our pan-European geographical coverage.)\nWe believe that CEEMID could fulfil the functions of the European Music Industry if it would find a sustainable financing that makes access to all our data open. We need to be able to avoid the tragedy of the commons, where only a few industry users contribute to the financing of thousands of indicators that could potentially benefits tens of thousands of stakeholders in the EU.\n","date":1551222000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551222000,"objectID":"f9ecb6b3cbc70328e0e3434240c3c0d5","permalink":"/project/ceemid/","publishdate":"2019-02-27T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/ceemid/","section":"project","summary":"CEEMID","tags":["ceemid","surveys"],"title":"CEEMID","type":"project"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal"],"categories":null,"content":"\nThis package was related to several of my works for Slovak, Hungarian and Croatian music industry and the Hungarian Film Fund, and my collaboration with Eeconomic impacT s.r.o in the Czech Republic.

In popular music performers usually play their own composition and sing their own lyrics. If the musician is self-published, all the three royalties directly pay the artist’s work. If a professional publisher is helping the artist as a composer, or a record producer as a recorded performer, they usually share the respective royalty revenues. In emerging markets fewer, in mature markets more composers are represented by publishers and performers by record labels.\nInternational Comparisons The CEEMID international comparison models are based on the implicit econometric model set out in the AKKA/LAA vs Konkurences padome case which goes far beyond the regional comparison suggested by the earlier Czech Léčebné lázně Mariánské Lázně v OSA case for comparing royalty tariffs in the European Union.\nThe EUCJ declared that “it is appropriate to compare its rates with those applicable in neighbouring Member States as well as with those applicable in other Member States adjusted in accordance with the PPP index, provided that the reference Member States have been selected in accordance with objective, appropriate and verifiable criteria and that the comparisons are made on a consistent basis.”\nIn our view, setting a royalty tariff, especially when comparison of other market prices is taken into consideration, should follow the principles of the IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement international accounting standard. This accounting standard was endorsed as an official interpretation of accounting principles by the EU Commission Regulation Regulation 2012/125, which is in turn a binding interpretation in the light of the directly applicable 1126/2008 EC Regulation. This document gives a practical guidance on how to use objective data in valuations. Although the language of the standard is mainly aimed at large corporation with heterogenous balance sheets, as a canonical, cross-country reading of sound accounting principles it is applicable for establishing the fair value of an assets or liabilities, including intangible assets such as royalty-earning copyright and neighboring rights.\nOn the top level of the hierarchy we find publicly observable prices in frequently traded assets, which is not applicable in our case. The second level of the hierarchy contains more reliable, publicly verifiable data sources and the third level of the hierarchy non-public information that is objective. Whenever possible, publicly available and verified information should be used.\nThe structure of the music and audiovisual industries makes the use of Level 1 input data almost impossible in a European context, because the vast majority of the industry players are microenterprises and sole solicitors, and even larger entities such as collective management societies and TV stations usually fall in the scope of the EU small- and medium size enterprise category. With few exceptions, this is the case with HORECA tariff payers, i.e. restaurants, pensions, hotels and other similar establishments. Micro-, small and medium sized enterprises are usually subject to simplified and limited financial reporting, tax reporting rules and mandatory official statistical reporting rules. Most of the EU economic statistics are created from tax and financial reports, and in other cases from mandatory statistical reports. Because creative and cultural enterprises usually do not fall into the threshold set for most enterprise statistics data collection, and because of the simplified tax and accounting reports, less official statistics can be created.\nIn the absence of high-level valuation input data, we must use level 2 (public) and level 3 (private) data sources that are by nature subject to interpretation. Such interpretation is subjective in the language of the standard because it is personally made by an objective analyst. The reliability of the valuation depends not only on the quality of the data, which is the case with level 1 data, but on the sound analysis of a competent analyst.\nCEEMID made a large effort in the last 5 years to use high quality, publicly observable data and private data to create meaningful and objective social, economic and cultural indicators as set out in the EUCJ preliminary decision.\nMarket Comparators The best models are based on market data and use information on prices and quantities agreed by independent, arms-length contractual partners. Our market comparator models process all collectively managed and estimated individually licensed uses of music and audiovisual content in a country. It is than possible to compare private copying values, value transfer to media platforms, or individual uses such as radio or television to the total market value of music listening per hour or film watching per hour. These models require the most data input.\nWe used such estimates in the Slovak Music Industry Report, in the calculation of private copying benefits to consumers and value transfer to YouTube in Hungary and Croatia.\nDirect Estimates \u0026amp; Hypothetical Evaluations Direct estimates are measuring quantities of unknown uses and they relate them to known market prices. Hypothetical evaluations ask the willingness of users to pay for uses. These models are easier to create, require less information, but they can be more easily challenged by regulators, licensees or auditors, because they do not rely only on independent and arms-length transaction data.\nHedonic Pricing Hedonic price models are econometric price models that establish the residua value of music in complex services like hoteling or restaurant services. We have used hedonic price modelling to establish the value of music use in the HORECA sector. Technically these models could be used to evaluate the use in television or radio but the data requirements are extensive.\n","date":1546470000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558099980,"objectID":"12972acfcd81049e068ee2b4d261795f","permalink":"/usecase/royalty_setting/","publishdate":"2019-01-03T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/usecase/royalty_setting/","section":"usecase","summary":"The copyright and neighboring right royalty is the wage-like earning of the music performer, the composer and producer.

There are many reasons for this, all a bit touched upon the other speaker’s issues, and their implementation difficulties n the CEE region, especially different revenue stream breakup, strong collective management and relatively underdeveloped publishing.

After several years on the stage musician’s got a recording contract, and usually even later they registered their first composition. The recording stream was the most important revenue source. The making of a record was expensive and offered considerable royalties or advances.\nIn the 21st century the live music stream is far more important than the recordings. Creating recordings is much cheaper and stage performances are expensive. Musicians usually create their music, also register it as a music work and offer it to the public on an online portfolio of mp3 downloads, YouTube and music streams. Often they are booked for their first live performance after publishing a recording.\nWhat does it mean for the musician and the manager? First and foremost that traditional career development strategies do not work anymore. A convincing stage performance is mandatory with a good touring strategy. Recordings are often not profitable, but equally important in building the audience. Making the recording stream a revenue stream instead of the cost stream requires a very good understanding of the costs and benefits of the different digital channels.

Our mandate was to create concrete granting proposals that have a high chance of making a change in terms of the later royalty earning capabilities of artists.\nIn the first phase of the project, we made two workshops with the eight fields development method to understand the challenges and existing working practices that result in a low level of royalties paid out in Hungary. This methodology requires a groupwork of all stakeholders and professionals of the industry. In this case, we worked in groups of 30-40, covering various artists, stage, light, sound technicians, producers, managers and even band transporters. One group predominantly was Budapest-based and one in Eastern Hungary, to have a different view on working and market conditions in the metropolitan city and in the countryside. While royalties are not applicable for live music, it was well understood by the granting authority and the music industry that royalties cannot grow without a healthy live music sector in the country.\nIn the workshop, the consultant with several aides facilitates a very structured conversation that starts with a desired state of the industry which is not described by slogans but by actual characterizations of a desired working environment. Instead of envisioning that “everybody gets a grant”, we describe the ideal project planning and management cycle of a new tour or record to see how a granting can fit into this workflow and what type of grants add effective assistance to realize goals. For each goal and change we envision how that effects the work of the performing artists, her manager, the technician crew, even the schedule of the tour bus driver. We discuss if the change makes any material change in the way we can prepare for a new album release.\nIn the latter stages what sort of changes we envision in day practices, programmers, institutions and what concrete steps are needed to be made to get there. As a controlling step, we assign indicators that can be objectively judged, and which can show the degree of change if recommended actions are taken.\nThe advantage of the eight-fields methodology, which was originally developed to support EU and global aid program design is that it allows conflicting viewpoints, finding consensus, and display very highly detailed policy and program scenarios already in a day. It is generally a very enjoyable experience for artists and professionals. If the workshop takes place over 2 days, a first draft program is already presented on the second morning and by the end of the day participants usually have a detailed program. In this case, we came up with dozens of concrete proposals, many of which could be addressed to the stakeholders themselves without any action taken from the granting authority.\n\r\r\r\r In the next stage we carried out the annual CEEMID Music Professional Survey with additional questions where artists, managers and technicians could rate the proposals. They could also optionally give their next year development priorities in the fields of live performances, recordings and composition, in the context of their current work, pre-existing financing and professional assistance of financial assistance needs. In Hungary, more than 1000 music professionals filled out the survey in 2015.\nAt the end of the workshop and the survey, we could present a very comprehensive policy and granting program, with preliminary estimates on granting needs, ideal and minimum grant sizes, and grant contractual conditions to avoid grant calls that cannot be contracted out to winners due to unrealistic prerequisites.\nThese results, with suggested cultural policy indicators, program indicators and budgetary outlines were presented to the granting authority of the Cseh Tamás Program (currently named: Hangfoglaló Popular Music Support Program)\n","date":1447351200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1447351200,"objectID":"2d9052525aadd6700d930e09f2721e9a","permalink":"/post/2015-11-12_cstp/","publishdate":"2015-11-12T19:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2015-11-12_cstp/","section":"post","summary":"The data and intelligence of CEEMID was used in Hungary to create an ex ante evaluation of the new Cseh Tamás Program to support popular music development in Hungary.
